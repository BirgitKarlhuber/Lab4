#' Algorithm to find the shortest path from an initial node to all other nodes in a graph
#' 
#' The algorithm takes a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest path from the initial node to every other node in the graph.
#'
#' @param graph data.frame with three variables (v1, v2 and w) that contains the 
#' edges of the graph (from v1 to v2) with the weight of the edge (w).
#' 
#' @param init_node A number corresponding to the start node
#'
#' @return The shortest path to every other node from the starting node as a vector.
